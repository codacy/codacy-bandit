Bandit is a tool designed to find common security issues in Python code. To do this Bandit processes each file, builds an AST from it, and runs appropriate plugins against the AST nodes. Once Bandit has finished scanning all the files it generates a report. You can also use custom `.bandit` or `bandit.yml` config file. [Learn more](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit)
