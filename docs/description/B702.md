## B702: Test for use of mako templates<a href="#b702-test-for-use-of-mako-templates" class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a>

Mako is a Python templating system often used to build web applications.
It is the default templating system used in Pylons and Pyramid. Unlike
Jinja2 (an alternative templating system), Mako has no environment wide
variable escaping mechanism. Because of this, all input variables must
be carefully escaped before use to prevent possible vulnerabilities to
Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
