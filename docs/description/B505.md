## B505: Test for weak cryptographic key use

As computational power increases, so does the ability to break ciphers
with smaller key lengths. The recommended key length size for RSA and
DSA algorithms is 2048 and higher. 1024 bits and below are now
considered breakable. EC key length sizes are recommended to be 224 and
higher with 160 and below considered breakable. This plugin test checks
for use of any key less than those limits and returns a high severity
error if lower than the lower threshold and a medium severity error for
those lower than the higher threshold.

Example:

>> Issue: DSA key sizes below 1024 bits are considered breakable.
