## B601: Test for shell injection within Paramiko

Paramiko is a Python library designed to work with the SSH2 protocol for
secure (encrypted and authenticated) connections to remote machines. It
is intended to run commands on a remote host. These commands are run
within a shell on the target and are thus vulnerable to various shell
injection attacks. Bandit reports a MEDIUM issue when it detects the use
of Paramiko’s “exec\_command” method advising the user to check inputs
are correctly sanitized.
