## B601: Test for shell injection within Paramiko

Paramiko is a Python library designed to work with the SSH2 protocol for
secure (encrypted and authenticated) connections to remote machines. It
is intended to run commands on a remote host. These commands are run
within a shell on the target and are thus vulnerable to various shell
injection attacks. Bandit reports a MEDIUM issue when it detects the use
of Paramiko’s “exec\_command” method advising the user to check inputs
are correctly sanitized.

Example:

<!-- -->

    >> Issue: Possible shell injection via Paramiko call, check inputs are
    properly sanitized.
    Severity: Medium   Confidence: Medium
    CWE: CWE-78 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html)
    Location: ./examples/paramiko_injection.py:4
    3    # this is not safe
    4    paramiko.exec_command('something; really; unsafe')
