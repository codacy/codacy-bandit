## B103: Test for setting permissive file permissions

POSIX based operating systems utilize a permissions model to protect
access to parts of the file system. This model supports three roles
“owner”, “group” and “world” each role may have a combination of “read”,
“write” or “execute” flags sets. Python provides `chmod` to manipulate
POSIX style permissions.

This plugin test looks for the use of `chmod` and will alert when it is
used to set particularly permissive control flags. A MEDIUM warning is
generated if a file is set to group executable and a HIGH warning is
reported if a file is set world writable. Warnings are given with HIGH
confidence.

Example:

>> Issue: Probable insecure usage of temp file/directory.
Severity: Medium   Confidence: Medium
CWE: CWE-732 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/732.html)
Location: ./examples/os-chmod.py:15
14  os.chmod('/etc/hosts', 0o777)
15  os.chmod('/tmp/oh_hai', 0x1ff)
16  os.chmod('/etc/passwd', stat.S_IRWXU)

>> Issue: Chmod setting a permissive mask 0777 on file (key_file).
Severity: High   Confidence: High
CWE: CWE-732 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/732.html)
Location: ./examples/os-chmod.py:17
16  os.chmod('/etc/passwd', stat.S_IRWXU)
17  os.chmod(key_file, 0o777)
