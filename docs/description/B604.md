**B604: Test for any function with shell equals true**

Python possesses many mechanisms to invoke an external executable.
However, doing so may present a security issue if appropriate care is
not taken to sanitize any user provided or variable input.

This plugin test is part of a family of tests built to check for process
spawning and warn appropriately. Specifically, this plugin test
interrogates method calls for the presence of a keyword parameter shell
equalling true. It is related to detection of shell injection issues and
is intended to catch custom wrappers to vulnerable methods that may have
been created.

- ../plugins/start_process_with_partial_path

**Config Options:**

This plugin test shares a configuration with others in the same family,
namely shell_injection. This configuration is divided up into three
sections, subprocess, shell and no_shell. They each list Python calls
that spawn subprocesses, invoke commands within a shell, or invoke
commands without a shell (by replacing the calling process)
respectively.

Specifically, this plugin excludes those functions listed under the
subprocess section, these methods are tested in a separate specific test
plugin and this exclusion prevents duplicate issue reporting.

    shell_injection:
        # Start a process using the subprocess module, or one of its
        wrappers.
        subprocess: [subprocess.Popen, subprocess.call,
                     subprocess.check_call, subprocess.check_output
                     execute_with_timeout]
