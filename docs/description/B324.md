## B324: Test use of insecure md4, md5, or sha1 hash functions in hashlib

This plugin checks for the usage of the insecure MD4, MD5, or SHA1 hash functions in hashlib and crypt. The hashlib.new function provides the ability to construct a new hashing object using the named algorithm. This can be used to create insecure hash functions like MD4 and MD5 if they are passed as algorithm names to this function.

For Python versions prior to 3.9, this check is similar to B303 blacklist except that this checks for insecure hash functions created using hashlib.new function. For Python version 3.9 and later, this check does additional checking for usage of keyword usedforsecurity on all function variations of hashlib.

Similar to hashlib, this plugin also checks for usage of one of the crypt moduleâ€™s weak hashes. crypt also permits MD5 among other weak hash variants.

Example:
