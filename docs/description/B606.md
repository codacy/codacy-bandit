**B606: Test for starting a process with no shell**

Python possesses many mechanisms to invoke an external executable.
However, doing so may present a security issue if appropriate care is
not taken to sanitize any user provided or variable input.

This plugin test is part of a family of tests built to check for process
spawning and warn appropriately. Specifically, this test looks for the
spawning of a subprocess in a way that doesn’t use a shell. Although
this is generally safe, it maybe useful for penetration testing
workflows to track where external system calls are used. As such a LOW
severity message is generated.

**Config Options:**

This plugin test shares a configuration with others in the same family,
namely shell\_injection. This configuration is divided up into three
sections, subprocess, shell and no\_shell. They each list Python calls
that spawn subprocesses, invoke commands within a shell, or invoke
commands without a shell (by replacing the calling process)
respectively.

This plugin specifically scans for methods listed in no\_shell section.

    shell_injection:
        no_shell:
            - os.execl
            - os.execle
            - os.execlp
            - os.execlpe
            - os.execv
            - os.execve
            - os.execvp
            - os.execvpe
            - os.spawnl
            - os.spawnle
            - os.spawnlp
            - os.spawnlpe
            - os.spawnv
            - os.spawnve
            - os.spawnvp
            - os.spawnvpe
            - os.startfile
