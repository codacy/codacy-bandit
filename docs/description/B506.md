## B506: Test for use of yaml load<a href="#b506-test-for-use-of-yaml-load" class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a>

This plugin test checks for the unsafe usage of the `yaml.load` function
from the PyYAML package. The yaml.load function provides the ability to
construct an arbitrary Python object, which may be dangerous if you
receive a YAML document from an untrusted source. The function
yaml.safe\_load limits this ability to simple Python objects like
integers or lists.

Please see <http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation#LoadingYAML> for
more information on `yaml.load` and yaml.safe\_load
