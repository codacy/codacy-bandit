## B201: Test for use of flask app with debug set to true

Running Flask applications in debug mode results in the Werkzeug
debugger being enabled. This includes a feature that allows arbitrary
code execution. Documentation for both Flask
<a href="#id4" id="id1" class="footnote-reference brackets">1</a> and
Werkzeug
<a href="#id5" id="id2" class="footnote-reference brackets">2</a>
strongly suggests that debug mode should never be enabled on production
systems.

Operating a production server with debug mode enabled was the probable
cause of the Patreon breach in 2015
<a href="#id6" id="id3" class="footnote-reference brackets">3</a>.

Example:

    >> Issue: A Flask app appears to be run with debug=True, which exposes
    the Werkzeug debugger and allows the execution of arbitrary code.
