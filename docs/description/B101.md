## B101: Test for use of assert

This plugin test checks for the use of the Python `assert` keyword. It
was discovered that some projects used assert to enforce interface
constraints. However, assert is removed with compiling to optimised byte
code (python -o producing \*.pyo files). This caused various protections
to be removed. Consider raising a semantically meaningful error or
`AssertionError` instead.

Please see
<https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-assert-statement>
for more info on `assert`.

**Config Options:**

You can configure files that skip this check. This is often useful when
you use assert statements in test cases.

`assert_used:
skips: ['*_test.py', '*test_*.py']`


Example:

>> Issue: Use of assert detected. The enclosed code will be removed when
compiling to optimised byte code.
