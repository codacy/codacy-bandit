## B608: Test for SQL injection

An SQL injection attack consists of insertion or “injection” of a SQL
query via the input data given to an application. It is a very common

issue is reported. In order to boost result confidence, this plugin test
will also check to see if the discovered string is in use with standard
Python DBAPI calls execute or executemany. If so, a MEDIUM issue is
reported. For example:
