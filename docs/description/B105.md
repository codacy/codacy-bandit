**B105: Test for use of hard-coded password strings**

The use of hard-coded passwords increases the possibility of password
guessing tremendously. This plugin test looks for all string literals
and checks the following conditions:

- assigned to a variable that looks like a password

- assigned to a dict key that looks like a password

- assigned to a class attribute that looks like a password

- used in a comparison with a variable that looks like a password

Variables are considered to look like a password if they have match any
one of:

- “password”

- “pass”

- “passwd”

- “pwd”

- “secret”

- “token”

- “secrete”

Note: this can be noisy and may generate false positives.

**Config Options:**

None

Example

:

    >> Issue: Possible hardcoded password '(root)'
       Severity: Low   Confidence: Low
       CWE: CWE-259 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/259.html)
       Location: ./examples/hardcoded-passwords.py:5
    4 def someFunction2(password):
    5     if password == "root":
    6         print("OK, logged in")
