## B507: Test for missing host key validation<a href="#b507-test-for-missing-host-key-validation" class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a>

Encryption in general is typically critical to the security of many
applications. Using SSH can greatly increase security by guaranteeing
the identity of the party you are communicating with. This is
accomplished by one or both parties presenting trusted host keys during
the connection initialization phase of SSH.

When paramiko methods are used, host keys are verified by default. If
host key verification is disabled, Bandit will return a HIGH severity
error.
