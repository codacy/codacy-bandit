**B503: Test for SSL use with bad defaults specified**

This plugin is part of a family of tests that detect the use of known
bad versions of SSL/TLS, please see ../plugins/ssl\_with\_bad\_version
for a complete discussion. Specifically, this plugin test scans for
Python methods with default parameter values that specify the use of
broken SSL/TLS protocol versions. Currently, detection supports methods
using Pythonâ€™s native SSL/TLS support and the pyOpenSSL module. A MEDIUM
severity warning will be reported whenever known broken protocol
versions are detected.

**Config Options:**

This test shares the configuration provided for the standard
../plugins/ssl\_with\_bad\_version test, please refer to its
documentation.

Example  

<!-- -->

    >> Issue: Function definition identified with insecure SSL/TLS protocol
    version by default, possible security issue.
