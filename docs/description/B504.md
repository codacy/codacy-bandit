**B504: Test for SSL use with no version specified**

This plugin is part of a family of tests that detect the use of known
bad versions of SSL/TLS, please see ../plugins/ssl\_with\_bad\_version
for a complete discussion. Specifically, This plugin test scans for
specific methods in Pythonâ€™s native SSL/TLS support and the pyOpenSSL
module that configure the version of SSL/TLS protocol to use. These
methods are known to provide default value that maximize compatibility,
but permit use of the aforementioned broken protocol versions. A LOW
severity warning will be reported whenever this is detected.

**Config Options:**

This test shares the configuration provided for the standard
../plugins/ssl\_with\_bad\_version test, please refer to its
documentation.

Example  

<!-- -->

    >> Issue: ssl.wrap_socket call with no SSL/TLS protocol version
    specified, the default SSLv23 could be insecure, possible security
    issue.
       Severity: Low   Confidence: Medium
       Location: ./examples/ssl-insecure-version.py:23
    22
    23  ssl.wrap_socket()
