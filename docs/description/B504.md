**B504: Test for SSL use with no version specified**

This plugin is part of a family of tests that detect the use of known
bad versions of SSL/TLS, please see

../plugins/ssl_with_bad_version for a complete discussion. Specifically,
This plugin test scans for specific methods in Pythonâ€™s native SSL/TLS
support and the pyOpenSSL module that configure the version of SSL/TLS
protocol to use. These methods are known to provide default value that
maximize compatibility, but permit use of the aforementioned broken
protocol versions. A LOW severity warning will be reported whenever this
is detected.

**Config Options:**

This test shares the configuration provided for the standard

../plugins/ssl_with_bad_version test, please refer to its documentation.

Example

:

    >> Issue: ssl.wrap_socket call with no SSL/TLS protocol version
    specified, the default SSLv23 could be insecure, possible security
    issue.
       Severity: Low   Confidence: Medium
       CWE: CWE-327 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/327.html)
       Location: ./examples/ssl-insecure-version.py:23
    22
    23  ssl.wrap_socket()
    24
