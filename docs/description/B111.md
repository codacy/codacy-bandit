# B111: Test for the use of rootwrap running as root

This plugin has been removed.

Running commands as root dramatically increase their potential risk.
Running commands with restricted user privileges provides defense in
depth against command injection attacks, or developer and configuration
error. This plugin test checks for specific methods being called with a
keyword parameter run\_as\_root set to True, a common OpenStack idiom.


**Config Options:**

This test plugin takes a similarly named configuration block, execute_with_run_as_root_equals_true, providing a list, function_names, of function names. A call to any of these named functions will be checked for a run_as_root keyword parameter, and if True, will report a Low severity issue.

execute_with_run_as_root_equals_true:
    function_names:
- ceilometer.utils.execute
- cinder.utils.execute
- neutron.agent.linux.utils.execute
- nova.utils.execute
- nova.utils.trycmd

Example:

>> Issue: Execute with run_as_root=True identified, possible security
issue.
Severity: Low   Confidence: Medium
Location: ./examples/exec-as-root.py:26
25  nova_utils.trycmd('gcc --version')
26  nova_utils.trycmd('gcc --version', run_as_root=True)
