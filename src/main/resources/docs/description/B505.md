B505: Test for weak cryptographic key use
-----------------------------------------

As computational power increases, so does the ability to break ciphers with
smaller key lengths. The recommended key length size for RSA and DSA algorithms
is 2048 and higher. 1024 bits and below are now considered breakable. EC key
length sizes are recommended to be 224 and higher with 160 and below considered
breakable. This plugin test checks for use of any key less than those limits
and returns a high severity error if lower than the lower threshold and a
medium severity error for those lower than the higher threshold.
