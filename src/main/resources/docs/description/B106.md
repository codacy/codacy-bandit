**B106: Test for use of hard-coded password function arguments**

The use of hard-coded passwords increases the possibility of password
guessing tremendously. This plugin test looks for all function calls
being passed a keyword argument that is a string literal. It checks that
the assigned local variable does not look like a password.

Variables are considered to look like a password if they have match any
one of:

-   “password”
-   “pass”
-   “passwd”
-   “pwd”
-   “secret”
-   “token”
-   “secrete”

Note: this can be noisy and may generate false positives.

**Config Options:**

None
