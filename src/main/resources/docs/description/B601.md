B601: Test for shell injection within Paramiko
----------------------------------------------

Paramiko is a Python library designed to work with the SSH2 protocol for
secure (encrypted and authenticated) connections to remote machines. It
is intended to run commands on a remote host. These commands are run
within a shell on the target and are thus vulnerable to various shell
injection attacks. Bandit reports a MEDIUM issue when it detects the use
of Paramiko’s “exec\_command” or “invoke\_shell” methods advising the
user to check inputs are correctly sanitized.

    >> Issue: Possible shell injection via Paramiko call, check inputs are
       properly sanitized.
       Severity: Medium   Confidence: Medium
       Location: ./examples/paramiko_injection.py:4
    3    # this is not safe
    4    paramiko.exec_command('something; reallly; unsafe')

    >> Issue: Possible shell injection via Paramiko call, check inputs are
       properly sanitized.
       Severity: Medium   Confidence: Medium
       Location: ./examples/paramiko_injection.py:10
    9    # this is not safe
    10   SSHClient.invoke_shell('something; bad; here\n')
