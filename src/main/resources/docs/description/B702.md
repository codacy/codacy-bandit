## Avoid the usage of mako templates

Mako is a Python templating system often used to build web applications. It is the default templating system used in Pylons and Pyramid. Unlike Jinja2 (an alternative templating system), Mako has no environment wide variable escaping mechanism. Because of this, all input variables must be carefully escaped before use to prevent possible vulnerabilities to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
