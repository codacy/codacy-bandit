**B603: Test for use of subprocess with shell equals true**

Python possesses many mechanisms to invoke an external executable.
However, doing so may present a security issue if appropriate care is
not taken to sanitize any user provided or variable input.

This plugin test is part of a family of tests built to check for process
spawning and warn appropriately. Specifically, this test looks for the
spawning of a subprocess without the use of a command shell. This type
of subprocess invocation is not vulnerable to shell injection attacks,
but care should still be taken to ensure validity of input.

Because this is a lesser issue than that described in
subprocess\_popen\_with\_shell\_equals\_true a LOW severity warning is
reported.

**Config Options:**

This plugin test shares a configuration with others in the same family,
namely shell\_injection. This configuration is divided up into three
sections, subprocess, shell and no\_shell. They each list Python calls
that spawn subprocesses, invoke commands within a shell, or invoke
commands without a shell (by replacing the calling process)
respectively.

This plugin specifically scans for methods listed in subprocess section
that have shell=False specified.
