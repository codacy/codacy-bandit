## B101: Test for use of assert

This plugin test checks for the use of the Python `assert` keyword. It
was discovered that some projects used assert to enforce interface
constraints. However, assert is removed with compiling to optimised byte
code (python -o producing \*.pyo files). This caused various protections
to be removed. The use of assert is also considered as general bad
practice in OpenStack codebases.
