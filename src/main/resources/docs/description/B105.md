**B105: Test for use of hard-coded password strings**

The use of hard-coded passwords increases the possibility of password
guessing tremendously. This plugin test looks for all string literals
and checks the following conditions:

-   assigned to a variable that looks like a password
-   assigned to a dict key that looks like a password
-   used in a comparison with a variable that looks like a password

Variables are considered to look like a password if they have match any
one of:

-   “password”
-   “pass”
-   “passwd”
-   “pwd”
-   “secret”
-   “token”
-   “secrete”

Note: this can be noisy and may generate false positives.

**Config Options:**

None
