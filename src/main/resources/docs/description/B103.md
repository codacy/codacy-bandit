## B103: Test for setting permissive file permissions

POSIX based operating systems utilize a permissions model to protect
access to parts of the file system. This model supports three roles
“owner”, “group” and “world” each role may have a combination of
“read”, “write” or “execute” flags sets. Python provides `chmod` to
manipulate POSIX style permissions.

This plugin test looks for the use of `chmod` and will alert when it is
used to set particularly permissive control flags. A MEDIUM warning is
generated if a file is set to group executable and a HIGH warning is
reported if a file is set world writable. Warnings are given with HIGH
confidence.
