### B414: import_pycryptodome {#b414-import-pycryptodome}

This import blacklist has been removed. The information here has been
left for historical purposes.

pycryptodome is a direct fork of pycrypto that has not fully addressed
the issues inherent in PyCrypto. It seems to exist, mainly, as an API
compatible continuation of pycrypto and should be deprecated in favor
of pyca/cryptography which has more support among the Python community.
