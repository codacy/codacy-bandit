B108: Test for insecure usage of tmp file/directory
---------------------------------------------------

Safely creating a temporary file or directory means following a number
of rules (see the references for more details). This plugin test looks
for strings starting with (configurable) commonly used temporary paths,
for example:

**Config Options:**

This test plugin takes a similarly named config block,
hardcoded\_tmp\_directory. The config block provides a Python list,
tmp\_dirs, that lists string fragments indicating possible temporary
file paths. Any string starting with one of these fragments will report
a MEDIUM confidence issue.
