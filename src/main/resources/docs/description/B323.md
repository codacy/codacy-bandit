### B323: unverified_context {#b323-unverified-context}

By default, Python will create a secure, verified ssl context for use in such
classes as HTTPSConnection. However, it still allows using an insecure
context via the _create_unverified_context that reverts to the previous
behavior that does not validate certificates or perform hostname checks.
