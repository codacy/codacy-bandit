B104: Test for binding to all interfaces
----------------------------------------

Binding to all network interfaces can potentially open up a service to
traffic on unintended interfaces, that may not be properly documented or
secured. This plugin test looks for a string pattern “0.0.0.0” that may
indicate a hardcoded binding to all network interfaces.
