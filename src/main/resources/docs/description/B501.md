B501: Test for missing certificate validation
---------------------------------------------

Encryption in general is typically critical to the security of many
applications. Using TLS can greatly increase security by guaranteeing
the identity of the party you are communicating with. This is
accomplished by one or both parties presenting trusted certificates
during the connection initialization phase of TLS.

When request methods are used certificates are validated automatically
which is the desired behavior. If certificate validation is explicitly
turned off Bandit will return a HIGH severity error.
