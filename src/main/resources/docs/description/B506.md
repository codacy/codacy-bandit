B506: Test for use of yaml load
-------------------------------

This plugin test checks for the unsafe usage of the yaml.load function from
the PyYAML package. The yaml.load function provides the ability to construct
an arbitrary Python object, which may be dangerous if you receive a YAML
document from an untrusted source. The function yaml.safe_load limits this
ability to simple Python objects like integers or lists.

Please see
<http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation#LoadingYAML> for more information
on yaml.load and yaml.safe_load
